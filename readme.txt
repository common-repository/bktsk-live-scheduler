To set up custom post type and taxonomy for YouTube Live Schedules.

== Description ==

This plugin will set up a custom post type and taxonomy for live schedule like YouTube Live.

On the new post type, you can use original custom field section including type of the schedule (time fixed schedule, time not fixed (only date fixed) schedule, canceled schedule and day off schedule) and the urls.

Also iCalendar file can be delivered.  It can be imported with URL to the major calendar apps (e.g. Google Calendar, Apple Calendar App and so on).

== Frequently asked questions ==

### What can be done with this plugin?

You can make YouTube Live schedule as each posts.  Of course, this information will be automatically used for making iCalendar file.
The iCalendar file would be delivered using specified url (you can change the slug for that on the setting page), so everyone can subscribe it to major calendar apps or services.

### Is this able to show the calendar?

At last, we got the shortcode to show the calendar.
Use this shortcode to show the one.
```
[bktsk-live-calendar]
```

If you put this shortcode in the page, the pagenation will be automatically enabled.

Also if you need to keep the exact month calendar to show, you can use the shortcode like below.

```
[bktsk-live-calendar year=2020 month=5]
```

If you set only month option, the year will be this year (as same as now).
Of course you can set only year option, the month will be this month.

### Donation?

I'm so happy to get a donation.
